Samsung Upgrade Programme page 

It is a flexible and easy payment option that enables you to purchase the latest Galaxy phone and then upgrade every year. Taking part in the Samsung Upgrade Programme means that you will enter into an interest-free credit agreement (0% APR) with our chosen finance provider, Klarna Bank AB. After 12 months, you will have the option to continue your monthly payments or upgrade to the latest Galaxy phone by applying for a new credit agreement with Klarna Bank AB. Failure to make repayments in accordance with your credit agreement may have a negative impact on your credit score and lead to additional charges being applied.

The Samsung Upgrade Programme is only available to UK residents who purchase their Galaxy phone from this website. You must add an eligible Galaxy phone to your basket and select the relevant option during the checkout process. If your application is successful, you will become a member of the Samsung Upgrade Programme. Please note that in order to qualify for this option, you can only purchase an eligible Galaxy phone – the Samsung Upgrade Programme is not available on other products such as accessories or other category products (e.g. TV).

How it works
 
You pay 10% of the phone’s price upfront, followed by 23 equal monthly instalments, equivalent to 70% of the phone’s price split into 23 payments, and then a 24th final instalment, equivalent to 20% of the phone’s price. You keep the phone. Alternatively, if after 24 months you don’t want to keep the phone, you can return the phone and upgrade. Alternatively, subject to the minimum return conditions detailed in paragraph 5 of the Samsung Upgrade Programme terms and conditions (under “Existing Handset Requirements”), we can purchase the phone from you (with the payment from us for the device taking the form of Samsung settling the final instalment on your credit agreement). You can also choose to return your phone and upgrade to the latest Galaxy phone after 12 months, and have a 4-month window to upgrade. If you do not upgrade in the 4-month window, i.e. between the 12th and 16th month, you then have to wait until month 24 to upgrade.

Please visit the Samsung Upgrade Programme page for more information and FAQs about this finance option."

Payment and Finance	Has the TV Upgrade Programme been discontinued?	"Yes, the TV Upgrade Programme has been discontinued. Find out why and how this affects you.

The TV Upgrade Programme has been discontinued.
Why have you discontinued the TV Upgrade Programme?
 

Unfortunately, after reviewing our operating procedures as a result of COVID-19, we have decided to discontinue the TV Upgrade Programme, as it is not currently possible to offer this service and maintain safe social distancing measures, owing to the number of people required for the collection and removal of old TVs.

Will you be reinstating the TV Upgrade Programme in the future?
 

We currently have no plans to reinstate the TV Upgrade Programme, but we may review the situation, once COVID-19 is no longer a threat to public health.

Are you cancelling the Mobile Upgrade Programme as well?
 

No, Samsung Mobile Upgrade Programme is not affected and will continue to operate as usual.

I have already finished paying off my loan. Will I still be refunded?
 

Yes, if you received an email informing you of the refund, then you will be refunded.

I don’t think I have received my refund. What should I do?
 

You will only be able to see your refund on your annual loan statement from Klarna, which you will receive every 12 months, on the same day you took out the loan (i.e. 12, 24 and 36 months, followed by a closing letter). Please look out for a negative value on your statement (credit), labelled ‘Samsung TV gesture of goodwill'. If your next annual statement does not include this credit, then please contact Klarna customer service.

Are Samsung paying off two months of my loan for me?
 

No. We will credit the equivalent of two monthly instalments to the loan agreement you took out when you joined the TV Upgrade Programme. If you have outstanding payments to make to Klarna on your loan, these will continue as normal. You are still responsible for ensuring there are adequate funds in your account to cover any outstanding payments to Klarna."
